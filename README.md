# OOP
Describe an object from the real world â€“ a box in the shape of a parallelepiped. 
Create 4 separate such boxes with different size, calculate and show the volume of each box

# SOLID
Extend the functionality from task 1: boxes might be not only a parallelepiped, but also circle and a triangle prism. 
Each box has its own color. Color cannot be changed after box creation. 
Create 3-5 different boxes, calculate and show their volume.
